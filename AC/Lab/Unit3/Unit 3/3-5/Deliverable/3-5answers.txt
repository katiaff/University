1. No, because it depends on a constant (DNI) and a global variable whose virtual address is always the same.
2. Yes, because when the MMU translates a virtual address it is assigned a different physical address each time.

4. C0000000h
5. Yes, because the physical address is never the same so adding C0000000h to it would give different values.

	Since it is a data page of a task, it makes sense that it is 
	for reading and only allows supervisor only, since a common user
	should not be able to modify a task's data.
	Of course, then it is logical that it can be cached to access it faster.

    Present in main memory, present bit (0) set to 1
	Since this page allows writing on the audio interface, it makes sense
	that it requires supervisor access. 
	It also makes sense that it is present in memory and has been accessed
	before, since the system is loading data on it when booting (???)
