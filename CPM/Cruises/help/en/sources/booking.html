<h1>Filling your booking</h1>
<br/>
<p>Before starting to fill your booking, you have the option to load previous booking information you had, 
as long as it is for the <i>same</i> cruise. This can be done simply by clicking the "Open" button</p><br/>
<p>To fill your new booking, firstly you must specify the date you wish to depart among all the available dates.</p>
<br/>
<p>Then, choose a type of cabin. If you are 3 travellers or more, you can only choose a family room, 
unless you choose the "Extra Bed" option (only for children). However, you can still choose a family 
room if you are less than 3 travellers.</p><br/>
<p>Next, enter the date of birth of all the travellers. Take into account that a single cabin can host 
only children, but there <i>must</i> be at least one adult in the trip.</p></br>
<p>Finally, choose your extras by selecting as many as you want and click on "Book".</p><br/>
<p>Your booked cabin will be saved and added to your booking list.</p><br/>

<p>When you click on any item in your booking list, you can see a brief description of the booked cabin.</p><br/>
<p>You can also modify or remove any cabin in the list.</p><br/>
<p>By choosing modify, you will load the information of the selected cabin. If you choose to book the cabin
you are modifying, you will add a <i>new</i> booked cabin to the list. You will not lose the previous one.</p><br/>
<p>If you wish to delete any cabin from the list, simply select it and click the button "Remove".</p><br/><br/>
<p>When you are done booking, you may proceed to the used data window by clicking the "Proceed" button.</p><br/>
